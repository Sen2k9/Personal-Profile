    <h3>Smart Crowdsourcing Based Content Review System (SCCRS): An Approach to Improve Trustworthiness of Online Contents</h3>
<h4>7th International Conference, CSoNet 2018, Shanghai, China, December 18–20, 2018, Proceedings</h4>
      <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>Online media is now a significant carrier for quicker and ubiquitous diffusion of information. Any user in social media can post contents, provide news blogs, and engage in debate or opinion nowadays. Most of the posted pieces of information on social media are useful while some are fallacious and insulting to others. Keeping the promise of freedom of speech and simultaneously no tolerance against hate speech often becomes a challenge for the hosting services. Some automated tools were developed for content filtering in industries. Also, companies are hiring specialized reviewers for accurate and unbiased reporting. However, these approaches are not achieving the goal as expected, on the other hand, new strategies are being adopted to tweak the automated systems. To face the situation, we proposed a smart crowdsourcing based content review technique to provide trustworthy and unbiased reviews for online shared contents. In this techniques, we designed an intelligent self-learned crowdsourcing strategy to select an appropriate set of reviewers efficiently which ensures reviewers’ diversity, availability, quality, and familiarity with the news topic. To evaluate our proposed method, we developed a mobile app similar to popular social media (e.g., Facebook).

    <h3>A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Regenerate Image from a Reduce Scaled Image Using Bit Data Count
    </h3>
    <h4>BRAIN. Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience</h4>
      <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>Small scaled image lost some important bits of information which cannot be recovered when scaled back. Using multi-objective genetic algorithm, we can recover these lost bits. In this paper, we described a genetic algorithm approach to recover lost bits while image resized to the smaller version using the original image data bit counts which are stored while the image is scaled. This method is very scalable to apply in a distributed system. Also, the same method can be applied to recover error bits in any types of data blocks. In this paper, we showed proof of concept by providing the implementation and results.

    <h3>A modified penalty function in fuzzy clustering algorithm</h3>
    <h4>IEEE Intelligent Systems Conference (IntelliSys), 2017</h4>
      <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>Clustering is one of the most challenging tasks to organize and categorize data with the presence of noise and outliers. With the increase of overlapping especially in gene expression data, clustering ability decreases considerably. A number of exigent algorithms are available to confront such data in the field of biomedical engineering. The proposed approach demonstrates the modified penalty function using co-variance of membership in the objective function of standard fuzzy clustering algorithm. This may resolve the missing interaction among membership variables. In this proposed algorithm, highly and lightly expressed data points are separated more efficiently due to covariance pressure. The algorithm is described and compared with the most elevated techniques such as k-means (KM), fuzzy c-means (FCM), and penalized fuzzy c-means (PFCM) clustering techniques. These techniques are verified for different validity measures for artificial dataset and a Brain Tumor gene expression dataset. Our proposed clustering algorithm shows a much higher usability than the other related techniques.

        <h3>Estimation of Total Body Water Using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis</h3>
        <h4>IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI’19) jointly organised with The 16th IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN’19) (In Press)
        </h4>
          <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>This paper proposes mathematical models to estimate total body water (TBW) of human body based on bioelectrical impedance analysis. The models have been developed by linear regression analysis using 720 male and 735 female data and validated on 677 male and 685 female data which have not been used for model development. The results found from statistical analysis using proposed models have showed the better accuracy with respect to the actual data. The proposed models will be able to measure total body water more accurately comparing other existing models.</p>

      <h3>Leveraging Machine Learning Approach to Setup Software Defined Network(SDN) Controller Rules During DDoS Attack</h3>
      <h4>Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence. Algorithms for Intelligent Systems. Springer, Singapore
      </h4>
        <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>A machine learning based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection system, implemented in a virtual SDN environment testbed, has been presented in this paper. This system identifies whether any incoming traffic in a network is a DDoS type or not. To implement this approach, we applied AdaBoosting with decision stump as a weak classifier to train our model on a private network dataset in SDN environment. Our model showed up to 93% detection accuracy with a low false-positive rate. We have also tested and compared our model’s accuracy with different machine learning algorithms and presented the result.

    <h3>Battery Less Solar Power Controller to Drive Load at Constant Power Irrespective of Solar Radiation.</h3>
<h4> Journal of Energy Technology Research, [S.l.], v. 1, n. 2, p. 13-18, aug. 2017. ISSN 2514-4715.</h4>
      <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>In this paper, a 12V, 2.4W battery less solar power controller (BLSPC), capable of driving load at constant low power, has been proposed, designed and practically implemented with minimal efficiency sacrifice irrespective of solar radiance variation. This device utilizes power electronic circuits, more specifically a Buck-Boost DC-DC converter along with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm to perform the desired task. Starting from 100w/solar radiation the controller can provide constant power 2.4 watts at 12V without using any storage facilities. The output voltage can be adjusted to any desired level from 0V to 12V DC depending on the application at consumer premises. In this work, efficiency up to 90% at shadow weather phenomenon has been achieved. Moreover, this power controller can be used in consumer premises for direct-coupled system with solar panel irrespective of solar radiation variance.
